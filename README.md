# BrainHockey

Welcome to BrainHockey, a mind-bending twist on the classic arcade game Pong! Get ready to experience the future of gaming with brain-computer interface (BCI) technology from g.tec.

## What is BrainHockey?

BrainHockey is an innovative take on the beloved Pong game, where players use their brainpower to control the paddle instead of traditional keyboard or mouse inputs. Powered by g.tec Unicorn devices, BrainHockey taps into the potential of BCI technology, allowing players to move their paddle simply by focusing and concentrating on the Neurofeedback Targets.

## How to Play

1. **Download**: get the folder "BrainHockey.zip" from the ![release page](https://github.com/BRomans/BrainHockey/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and run the executable.
2. **Get Set Up**: Connect your g.tec Unicorn device and ensure it's properly calibrated on your brain.
3. **Focus and Concentrate**: Use your mental focus on the Neurofeedback Targets to control the paddle's movement.
4. **Compete or Collaborate**: Play against friends in multiplayer mode or challenge yourself in single-player mode.
5. **Score Points**: Keep your eye on the puck and deflect it past your opponent's paddle to score points.

## Coding Exercise
This project is part of a tutorial series to learn how to integrate a BCI into a videogame.
On the branch `coding-exercise` is possible to find a "vanilla" version of the game with only standard keyboard input and no UI.
(Coming soon!) The implementation of the neurogame step-by-step can be found on YouTube.
